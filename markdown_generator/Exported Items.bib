	abstract = {Quantifying the extent of degradation in a lithium-ion battery cell can provide valuable insights into the cell’s state of health. However, physics-based methods capable of diagnosing component-level degradation typically require long-term aging data and are computationally expensive to deploy. This work investigates combining physics-based modeling and data-driven machine learning to retain high diagnostic accuracy while mitigating the need for long-term degradation data. We develop a physics-informed neural network (PINN) algorithm to diagnose cell health in the late aging stage without needing long-term data. Using a small set of early-life experimental data from an aging experiment, we train a neural network using a physics-informed loss function which penalizes discrepancies between the neural network’s and the physics-based model’s estimates of four cell health parameters. The trained network can then estimate cell capacity and diagnose three primary degradation modes in the late-aging stage. The proposed method is evaluated and compared with other machine learning algorithms using data from a long-term ( 3.5 years) cycling experiment of 16 implantable-grade lithiumion cells. Cross-validation results show that the proposed PINN algorithm can improve the estimation accuracy of the health parameters compared to a purely data-driven approach and has comparable accuracy to the other two physics-informed machine learning methods.},

	abstract = {Monitoring the health of lithium-ion batteries’ internal components as they age is crucial for optimizing cell design and usage control strategies. However, quantifying component-level degradation typically involves aging many cells and destructively analyzing them throughout the aging test, limiting the scope of quantifiable degradation to the test conditions and duration. Fortunately, recent advances in physics-informed machine learning (PIML) for modeling and predicting the battery state of health demonstrate the feasibility of building models to predict the long-term degradation of a lithium-ion battery cell’s major components using only shortterm aging test data by leveraging physics. In this paper, we present four approaches for building physicsinformed machine learning models and comprehensively compare them, considering accuracy, complexity, ease-of-implementation, and their ability to extrapolate to untested conditions. We delve into the details of each physics-informed machine learning method, providing insights specific to implementing them on small battery aging datasets. Our study utilizes long-term cycle aging data from 24 implantable-grade lithium-ion cells sub­ jected to varying temperatures and C-rates over four years. This paper aims to facilitate the selection of an appropriate physics-informed machine learning method for predicting long-term degradation in lithium-ion batteries, using short-term aging data while also providing insights about when to choose which method for general predictive purposes.},

	abstract = {The ISU-ILCC battery aging dataset was collected jointly by the System Reliability and Safety Laboratory at Iowa State University (ISU), now the Reliability Engineering and Informatics Laboratory (REIL) at the University of Connecticut, and Iowa Lakes Community College (ILCC). The dataset is designed to study the dependency of battery capacity fade from three stress factors: charge rate, discharge rate, and depth of discharge. The dataset contains cycle aging data from 251 lithium-ion (Li-ion) polymer cells (also called lithium polymer cells) cycled under 63 unique conditions. The current release contains 238 cells; the other 12 cells have not completed the testing (data from those cells will be included in a future release).We would also like to acknowledge Zihao Zhou and Dr. David Howey from the Department of Engineering Science at the University of Oxford for their contributions to this publication.Change log: Release 2.0 folders added and readme file revised 12/2023.},

	abstract = {Accurate battery lifetime prediction is important for maintenance, warranties, and cell design. However, manufacturing variability and usage-dependent degradation make life prediction challenging. Here, we investigate new features derived from capacityvoltage data in early life to predict the lifetime of cells cycled under varying charge rates, discharge rates, and depths of discharge. The early-life features capture a cell’s state of health and the change rate of component-level degradation modes. Using a newly generated dataset from 225 nickel-manganese-cobalt/graphite lithium-ion cells aged under a wide range of conditions, we demonstrate a lifetime prediction of in-distribution cells with 15.1\% mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). A hierarchical Bayesian model shows improved performance on extrapolation, achieving 21.8\% MAPE for out-of-distribution cells. Our approach highlights the importance of using domain knowledge of battery degradation to inform feature engineering and model construction. Further, a new publicly available battery lifelong aging dataset is provided.},
